What is it?

   This program allows you to connect a MIPS EJTAG capable CPU to the PC parallel port. The CPU can then be booted from the PC, i.e. the PC loads the u-boot bootloader into the MIPS target SDRAM, and runs it.
   That way, you can bring up a MIPS board without having a programmed FLASH or similar on board.

   I have tested it on an AMD Alchemy Pb1000 board. It takes roughly 37 seconds to load u-boot into memory.
